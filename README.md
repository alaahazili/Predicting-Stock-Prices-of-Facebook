# Predicting Stock Prices

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting stock prices based on historical data. It explores various data processing techniques and machine learning models to forecast future stock movements.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Leveraging `pandas_datareader` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
- **Model Building**: Constructing an LSTM model to predict stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing the model's performance and accuracy.
